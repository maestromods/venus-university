# Mods in this build

This branch is a proposal for how the community mods share one build: every mod's code is
always in the game, and a switch decides whether it acts. Players turn mods on and off from
**Mods** on the main menu; nothing is chosen at install time.

This source port adds [City Life](docs/mods/city-life.md) to the framework on Venus
University's 0.3.0 source. Locations and jobs have separate per-playthrough switches.

## The three things a mod does

**1. Register** in `MODS`, in `src/shared/mods.ts`:

```ts
{
  id: 'city-life-locations',        // written to disk: never changes once shipped
  name: 'City Life locations',
  author: 'Maestro Leeds',
  version: '1.7.1',
  scope: 'playthrough',             // or 'anytime', see below
  defaultOn: true,
  blurb: 'Three new places on the map.',
  requires: [],                     // ids of mods this one cannot act without
  options: [{ id: 'some-option', label: '…', hint: '…', default: true }]
}
```

That is all the Mods screen, the main menu's count and the log need.

**2. Ask before acting**, wherever the mod would do something:

```ts
// in a component
const on = useModOn('city-life-locations', record)
// anywhere else in the renderer
if (modIsOn('city-life-locations', record)) { … }
// in main or shared code, with the switches in hand
modOn(switches, 'city-life-locations', record)
```

An option is read the same way: `useModOption(modId, optionId)` or `optionOn(switches, …)`.

**3. Keep its data when it is off.** Off stops a mod acting. It never deletes what the mod
wrote, so a save always loads and switching back on finds everything where it was.

## The two kinds of switch

- **`anytime`**: read where the mod acts. The player can flip it whenever they like. Use it
  for anything a save does not depend on.
- **`playthrough`**: fixed when a playthrough starts. The playthrough's record names the mods
  it started with (`record.mods`), and `modOn(…, record)` answers from that, whatever the
  switch says later. The switch is what a *new* playthrough gets. Use it for a mod that changes
  the game's rules or adds things a save refers to.

Pass the playthrough's record whenever there is one. With none, a `playthrough` mod answers
what a new playthrough would get. A record written before this list existed names no mods, so
no `playthrough` mod is on for it.

A mod whose requirement is off is off too, and comes back when the requirement does; its own
switch is left as the player set it.

## Where it is stored

- `data/mods.json`: the player's switches and options, `{ schemaVersion, on, options }`. A mod
  or option missing from it is at its default, so adding a mod needs no migration. Ids this
  build does not know are kept.
- `playthrough.json`: `mods`, the `playthrough` mods that playthrough started with.

## Where the code is

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/shared/mods.ts` | The list, the switches' shape and every rule above. No dependencies. |
| `src/main/services/modsService.ts` | Reads and writes `data/mods.json`. |
| `src/renderer/stores/modsStore.ts` | The switches in the renderer, and the hooks. |
| `src/renderer/views/ModsModal.tsx` | The Mods screen. |
| `test/mods.test.ts` | The rules, tested against a list with every shape of mod. |

## A rule in shared code

Shared code holds no switches. Where a rule there has to follow one, give the rule a flag with
a setter, and set it from `modsStore.ts` at boot and whenever a switch moves
(`useModsStore.subscribe`). Continuing Semesters does this for its seniors option.

## Not decided yet

- The build's name and version (`BUILD` in `mods.ts`).
- Whether `data/mods.json` goes into the game's own backup; it does not today.
- How a mod that patches the built code, rather than the source, reads its switch.
